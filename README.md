# Grocery_Scraper
Scrapes Kroger, Aldi, and Sprouts for cost of groceries given a grocery list.

Pulls the first 5 results by default, and gathers name and price info for each result.  Result amounts can be changed in settings.py, but it is recommended to not go over 10 due to website paginations.

Outputs data into csv file titled "Output.txt".  The file name can be changed inside main.py.
